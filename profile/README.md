TONION GitHub Organization

The Tonion is a team working on secure and reusable smart-contract implementations with the [Tact](https://tact-lang.org) on [TON](https://ton.org).
We are actively working on TON development tools and reference implementations.

The Tonion is powered by the [Dezh Technologies](https://github.com/dezh-tech) team, and the first reason for the creation of this team was to develop tools for Dezh's future and current projects.

We are open to all kinds of contributions are welcomed.ðŸ˜ƒ
